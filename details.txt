Hi there!

As part of the interview process, we would like you to complete an assignment as follows: 

To create a few simple backend APIs along with the backend database schema. 
You are free to use any language of your choice but you will get extra points for using Python with Flask/Django frameworks.

We would like you to build a simple relational database schema to manage a movie database. A movie typically has a name, year of release, user ratings, multiple genres, multiple actors, technicians, etc associated with it. You need to create a relational schema with proper relationships between different models/tables using any ORM of your choice if possible.

In terms of APIs, you will need to create these APIs,

GET and POST APIs to fetch a particular Movie, Add or Update a movie.
GET method to fetch all the movies - preferably paginated with custom filters like getting all movies of an actor or a director or a combination of actors/directors/technicians
POST API to delete an actor from the database if he or she is not associated with any movies

The deadline to complete the assignment is 11th November 2023. Once done, please host the code on GitHub and share the repo details with us here or on team@10xengg.com. Please reach out in case you have any questions. 

All the best!

Thanks,
Amal
